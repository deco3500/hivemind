Hivemind is a news aggregation application designed to provide a social solution for organising developing stories. Instead of curating a feed of posts which help develop one specific story - Hivemind aims to provide a solution wherein news articles can be linked together via user suggestions. Through this, the application allows users to view a peer assessed timeline of relevant articles to one particular topic, allowing the community to ensure that accurate and unsensationalised reporting is brought to the surface. As a result, we hope to provide a service which will enhance the community's understanding of world events in a greater context.

## Problem Space
### Our initial Problem Space
1. Improve network of news connections to previous relevant news and time-driven news 'expiry'. Extend exposure to past news and generation of full news story.

News has an unspoken expiry date from reporting. Current news has limited effect or callback to previous related information which may be relevant to current situation. Develop system that encompases previous news to outline relevance, and create a timeline of events over time.

2. Limit overexposure of commercialised news prone to bias and oversaturation of information

Community driven exposure to news and development of related content generation. Creating connections to expose extended news from outside singular articles.

### How our Problem Space Has Developed Over the Project
The problem space that was chosen to be addressed was that often news is dispersed over multiple agencies and that the news reported can greatly vary for the same event. Hivemind provides a social platform for users to vote articles up and down a scale based on their relevancy to a certain topic or event, and ensure that articles reporting the wrong facts are pushed down the scale. The app also allows users to view a comprehensive timeline of events based on an article's publishing date, so that they are able to see past news associated with an article. This adpatility and voting system allows users to control the flow of news, making it easier for them to find what they're looking for.

The main idea behind the article was that we really wanted to create a platform for people to view the news as a linked series of events. For example, I as a user want to read news regarding the US Presidential Election. For the most part, I can search Google to find the most current news for this event, though I don't really see the big picture of what's happening. Hivemind allows users to see the news as linked by both relevancy to other articles, and also on a timeline of publishing date. This connectivity helps to bridge the gap between a missing piece of news for a certain event, and also helps to make the news more relevant and credible. When users vote up an article's relevancy rating, it goes to the top of the relevant articles list which is linked to each article. A relevancy link doesn't change its position in the news timeline, as these are ordered by publishing date. The user population will for the most part determine the fate of each rating list. Users can add articles which they believe contribute to the greater understanding of each particular story, which other users are then able to vote on. 

## Design Process
The design process started with brainstorming ideas of how a soultuion could address an existing issue or dilemma in the domain of news or journalism. 

The style and design of these mockups was done with the purpose of being carried on to the final product, this way the colour scheme and layout could be decided upon early so other issues could be attended to.

The initial colour scheme and logo design ties in with the name Hivemind. The word hive has a common association with Bees, which further correlates into the bright yellow colour used for the colour palette. On top of this the logo is another play on the word Hivemind, as there are yellow hexagons in a honeycomb-like pattern(hive) inside a human head(mind). In regards to the remainder of the colour scheme, a simple application formula was used with light colours such as white and greys used for the tiles and background.

The app layout itself is another simple alteration of the classic news app design, with a list of articles in the form of clickable tiles with a simple facebook login screen previous to that which also displays the logo.
