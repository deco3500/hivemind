##Introduction
"This course is about new ideas. It is about looking at a domain — in this case news — and thinking about how social and web/mobile technologies can be applied in a way that might help people in that domain do things differently, to innovate. Using design thinking and methods, you will work in a multidisciplinary team to develop and deliver a digital, interactive prototype that demonstrates an innovation in news. To begin on this path you need come up with some ideas about what might be possible." - DECO3500 Assessment

## Concept/ About Hivemind
Hivemind is a news aggregation application specifically designed to provide a social solution for developing timelines of developing stories. Instead of creating curated feeds of posts which are then developed into stories themselves - Hivemind aims to provide a solution wherein news articles can be linked to one another through user suggestions.

##Hivemind Walkthrough
* The user opens the app on their device and logs into Facebook. The app can be used without logging in, though adding links or voting is not allowed for users who are not verified. This is to prevent spamming links, multiple votes on a single link, or adding articles which violate the terms of use.
