## Introduction
"This course is about new ideas. It is about looking at a domain — in this case news — and thinking about how social and web/mobile technologies can be applied in a way that might help people in that domain do things differently, to innovate. Using design thinking and methods, you will work in a multidisciplinary team to develop and deliver a digital, interactive prototype that demonstrates an innovation in news. To begin on this path you need come up with some ideas about what might be possible." - DECO3500 Assessment

The Hivemind project is currently designed using Marvel, an app prototyping platform. By initially designing the app using a prototyping platform, it is much easier and cheaper to find flaws in the application whilst completing a time sensitive project. The goal of the Hivemind application is provide a quick overview of events within the news, and provide a more connected and reliable platform to view a timeline of events.

## Concept/ About Hivemind
Hivemind is a news aggregation application specifically designed to provide a social solution for developing timelines of developing stories. Instead of creating curated feeds of posts which are then developed into stories themselves - Hivemind aims to provide a solution wherein news articles can be linked to one another through user suggestions. 


## Problem Space
### Our initial Problem Space
1. Improve network of news connections to previous relevant news and time-driven news 'expiry'. Extend exposure to past news and generation of full news story.

News has an unspoken expiry date from reporting. Current news has limited effect or callback to previous related information which may be relevant to current situation. Develop system that encompases previous news to outline relevance, and create a timeline of events over time.

2. Limit overexposure of commercialised news prone to bias and oversaturation of information

Community driven exposure to news and development of related content generation. Creating connections to expose extended news from outside singular articles.

### How our Problem Space Has Developed Over the Project
The problem space that was chosen to be addressed was that often news is dispersed over multiple agencies and that the news reported can greatly vary for the same event. Hivemind provides a social platform for users to vote articles up and down a scale based on their relevancy to a certain topic or event, and ensure that articles reporting the wrong facts are pushed down the scale. The app also allows users to view a comprehensive timeline of events based on an article's publishing date, so that they are able to see past news associated with an article. This adpatility and voting system allows users to control the flow of news, making it easier for them to find what they're looking for.

The main idea behind the article was that we really wanted to create a platform for people to view the news as a linked series of events. For example, I as a user want to read news regarding the US Presidential Election. For the most part, I can search Google to find the most current news for this event, though I don't really see the big picture of what's happening. Hivemind allows users to see the news as linked by both relevancy to other articles, and also on a timeline of publishing date. This connectivity helps to bridge the gap between a missing piece of news for a certain event, and also helps to make the news more relevant and credible. When users vote up an article's relevancy rating, it goes to the top of the relevant articles list which is linked to each article. A relevancy link doesn't change its position in the news timeline, as these are ordered by publishing date. The user population will for the most part determine the fate of each rating list. Users can add articles which they believe contribute to the greater understanding of each particular story, which other users are then able to vote on. 

## Design Process
The design process started with brainstorming ideas of how a soultuion could address an existing issue or dilemma in the domain of news or journalism. 

## Hivemind Walkthrough
* The user opens the app on their device and logs into Facebook. The app can be used without logging in, though adding links or voting is not allowed for users who are not verified. This is to prevent spamming links, multiple votes on a single link, or adding articles which violate the terms of use.
* The user then lands of the Hivemind main page, where they can toggle between an overview of Hot Stories, New Stories, and also Search for Stories. From the main page, users can also upadate their settings.
* As Hot Stories is featured on the main page, users see an overview on what's the top trending stories, as ordered by 1-50 (1 being the most popular, 50 being the least popular). This ranking is decided based on the average ranking for a story as voted for by users who may vote an article up or down.
* Users can also add links to any article in order to create a more comprehensive overview of a news event. If an added link is more credible or related to the original story, users can upvote it to the top of the list. Added links have an automatic relevancy rank of 5.0. This can be voted up to 10.0, or down to 1.0 by users.
* Links that have been added are not only ranked by relevancy, they can also be elected to be viewed as a timeline of events. Timelines are ordered by the publishing date which appears on the original article.
* The New Stories tab allows users to see which stories have the newest publishing date. This could be breaking news or general news.
* Clicking on the Search tab allows users to find specific articles of timelines of events.
* User settings can be changed under Settings, whereby a user can select their preferences and see a list of links that they have added to articles in te past, or recently voted on.
