##Introduction
"This course is about new ideas. It is about looking at a domain — in this case news — and thinking about how social and web/mobile technologies can be applied in a way that might help people in that domain do things differently, to innovate. Using design thinking and methods, you will work in a multidisciplinary team to develop and deliver a digital, interactive prototype that demonstrates an innovation in news. To begin on this path you need come up with some ideas about what might be possible." - DECO3500 Assessment

## Concept/ About Hivemind
Hivemind is a news aggregation application specifically designed to provide a social solution for developing timelines of developing stories. Instead of creating curated feeds of posts which are then developed into stories themselves - Hivemind aims to provide a solution wherein news articles can be linked to one another through user suggestions.

##Hivemind Walkthrough
* The user opens the app on their device and logs into Facebook. The app can be used without logging in, though adding links or voting is not allowed for users who are not verified. This is to prevent spamming links, multiple votes on a single link, or adding articles which violate the terms of use.
* The user then lands of the Hivemind main page, where they can toggle between an overview of Hot Stories, New Stories, and also Search for Stories. From the main page, users can also upadate their settings.
* As Hot Stories is featured on the main page, users see an overview on what's the top trending stories, as ordered by 1-50 (1 being the most popular, 50 being the least popular). This ranking is decided based on the average ranking for a story as voted for by users who may vote an article up or down.
* Users can also add links to any article in order to create a more comprehensive overview of a news event. If an added link is more credible or related to the original story, users can upvote it to the top of the list. Added links have an automatic relevancy rank of 5.0. This can be voted up to 10.0, or down to 1.0 by users.
* Links that have been added are not only ranked by relevancy, they can also be elected to be viewed as a timeline of events. Timelines are ordered by the publishing date which appears on the original article.
* The New Stories tab allows users to see which stories have the newest publishing date. This could be breaking news or general news.
* Clicking on the Search tab allows users to find specific articles of timelines of events.
* User settings can be changed under Settings, whereby a user can select their preferences and see a list of links that they have added to articles in te past, or recently voted on.
